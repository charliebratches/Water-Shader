GPU water simulation in real time on the Unity engine.



A body of water in this simulation supports multiple collisions and overlapping ripples. Ripples will collide with eachother & with walls, creating a complex ripple simulation that is still performant enough to use in a realtime game engine.
Check out some examples of the shader in-action on my twitter: https://twitter.com/CharlieBratches/status/1272199937716092930 https://twitter.com/CharlieBratches/status/1272201267977302016

*Note, I've included a tessellation shader from this catlike-coding article: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/advanced-rendering/tessellation/
This is just used to show off the heightfield water effect, and is used on the 3d rocks seen in the example gif.
